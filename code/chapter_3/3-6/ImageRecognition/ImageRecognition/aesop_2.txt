The Plane Tree
hy Aesoq
Two Travellers, walkjng in the noonday sun,
sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest,
As they lay lookjng up among the pleasant leaves,
they saw that jt was a Plane Tree.
"How useless js the Plane!" Sajd one of them. "It
bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter
the ground wjth leaves,"
"Ungrateful creatures!" Sajd a vojce from the
Plane Tree, "You lje here in my cooling shade,
and yet you say l am useless! Thus ungratefully,
o Jupiter, do men receive thejr blessjngs!"
0ur best blessjngs are o5en the least appreciated.
