The Plane Tree
by Aesop
Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun,
sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest.
As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves,
they saw that it was a Plane Tree.
"How useless is the Plane!" Said one of them. "It
bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter
the ground with leaves."
"Ungrateful creatures!" Said a voice from the
Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade,
and yet you say l am useless! Thus ungratefully,
o Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"
Our best blessings are oaen the least appreciated.
