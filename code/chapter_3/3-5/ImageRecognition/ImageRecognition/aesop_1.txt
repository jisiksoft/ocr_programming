The Ass And The L0ad Of salt
by Aesop
A Merchant. drivinq his Ass homeward from the
seashcre with a heavy load cf salt. came to a river
crossed by a shallow ford. They had crcssed this river
many times befcre without accident, but this time the
Ass slipped and fell when halYay over. And when the
Merchant at last qot him tc his feet, much cf the salt
had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter his
burden had become, the Ass finished the Journey very
qayly.
Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. on
the way hcme the Ass, rememberinq what had
happened at the fcrd, purpcsely let himself fall into the
water, and aqain qct rid of mcst cf his burden.
The angry Merchant immediately turned ahout and
drcve the Ass hack tc the seashcre. where he lcaded
him with twc great haskets of spcnqes. At the ford the
Ass aqain tumbled cver; hut when he had scrambled to
his feet, it was a very disconsolate Ass that draqged
himself hcmeward under a load ten times heavier than
before.
The same measures will not suit all circumstances.
