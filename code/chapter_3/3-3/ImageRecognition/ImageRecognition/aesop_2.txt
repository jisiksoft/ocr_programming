The Plane Tree
hy Aes0q
Two Travellersl walkjng in the noonday sunl
sought the shade of a widespreading tree to restl
As they lay lookjng up among the pleasant leavesl
they saw that jt was a Plane Treel
llHow useless js the Planelll sajd one of theml lllt
bears no fruit whateverl and only serves to litter
the ground wjth leaveslll
llUngrateful creaturesjll sajd a vojce from the
Plane Treel llYou lje here in my cooling shadel
and yet you say l am uselessj Thus ungratefullyl
O Jupiterl do men receive thejr blessjngsjll
Our best blessjngs are o8en the least appreciatedl
