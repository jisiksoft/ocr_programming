The Ass And The Load Of salt
by Aesop
A Merchantl driving his Ass homeward from the
seashcre with a heavy load cf saltl came to a river
crossed by a shallow fordl They had crcssed this river
many times befcre without accidentl but this time the
Ass slipped and fell when halYay overl And when the
Merchant at last got him tc his feetl mUch cf the salt
had melted awayl Delighted to find how much lighter his
burden had becomel the Ass finished the Journey very
gaylyl
Next day the Merchant went for another load of saltl Cn
the way hcme the Assl remembering what had
happened at the fcrdl pUrpcsely let himself fall into the
waterl and again gct rid of mcst cf his bUrdenl
The angry Merchant immediately turned ahout and
drcve the Ass hack tc the seashcrel where he lcaded
him with twc great haskets of spcngesl At the ford the
Ass again tumbled cverz hut when he had scrambled to
his feetl it was a very disconsolate Ass that dragged
himself hcmeward under a load ten times heavier than
beforel
The same measUres will not sUit all circumstancesl
