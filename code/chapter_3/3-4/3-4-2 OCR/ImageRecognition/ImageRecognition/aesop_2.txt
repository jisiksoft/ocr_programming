The Plane Tree
hy Aes0q
Two Travellers, walkjng in the noonday sun,
sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest,
As they lay lookjng up among the pleasant leaves,
they saw that jt was a Plane Treel
llHow useless js the Plane!ll sajd one of theml lllt
bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter
the ground wjth leaves,ll
llUngrateful creatures!ll sajd a vojce from the
Plane Tree, llYou lje here in my cooling shade,
and yet you say l am useless! Thus ungratefully,
0 Jupiter, do men receive thejr blessjngs!ll
0ur best blessjngs are o5en the least appreciatedl
