The Ass And The L0ad Of salt
by Aesop
A Merchantl drivinq his Ass homeward from the
seashcre with a heavy load cf saltl came to a river
crossed by a shallow fordl They had crcssed this river
many times befcre without accident, but this time the
Ass slipped and fell when halYay overl And when the
Merchant at last qot him tc his feet, much cf the salt
had melted awayl Delighted to find how much lighter his
burden had become, the Ass finished the Journey very
qaylyl
Next day the Merchant went for another load of saltl on
the way hcme the Ass, rememberinq what had
happened at the fcrd, purpcsely let himself fall into the
water, and aqain qct rid of mcst cf his burdenl
The angry Merchant immediately turned ahout and
drcve the Ass hack tc the seashcrel where he lcaded
him with twc great haskets of spcnqesl At the ford the
Ass aqain tumbled cver; hut when he had scrambled to
his feet, it was a very disconsolate Ass that draqged
himself hcmeward under a load ten times heavier than
beforel
The same measures will not suit all circumstancesl
